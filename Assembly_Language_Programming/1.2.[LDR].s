/*
    1. `LDR`: The `LDR` instruction is used to load a value from memory into a register. 
	For example, `ldr r0, [r1]` loads the value at the memory address contained in `r1` into `r0`ยน. 
	If the immediate value is small, the assembler will use `mov` to implement it, so `mov` and `ldr` are exactly the same if the immediate value is less or equal to 255.

    2. `MOV`: The `MOV` instruction is used to move an immediate value or a value stored in a register into a destination register. 
	For example, `mov r0, r1` moves the value in `r1` into `r0`ยน. `MOV` is really fast because it has the accompanying value directly stored as a part of the instruction.  

    In summary, while both `LDR` and `MOV` can be used to put a value into a register, 
	`LDR` is typically used when the value is in memory, 
	and `MOV` is used when the value is an immediate or is already in another register.
